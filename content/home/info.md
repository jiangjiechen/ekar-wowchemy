The ability to recognize analogies is fundamental to human cognition. Existing benchmarks to test word analogy do not reveal the underneath process of analogical reasoning of neural models. 

Holding the belief that models capable of reasoning should be right for the right reasons, we propose a first-of-its-kind Explainable Knowledge-intensive Analogical Reasoning benchmark (E-KAR). 
Our benchmark consists of 1,655 (in **Chinese**) and 1,251 (in **English**) problems sourced from **the Civil Service Exams**, which require intensive background knowledge to solve. 
More importantly, we design a **free-text explanation scheme** to explain whether an analogy should be drawn, and manually annotate them for *each and every question and candidate answer*.


## Data Instance

> **Query**: 
> 
> - tea: teapot: teacup
> 
> **Candidate Answers**: 
> 
> - A) passenger: bus: taxi
>  
> - B) magazine: bookshelf: reading room
> 
> - C) talents: school : enterprise
> 
> - D) textbooks: bookstore: printing factory
>  
> **Answer**: C
> 
> **Explanation for Query**:
> 
> - $E_Q$: Both "teapot" and "teacup" are containers for holding "tea". After the "tea" is brewed in the "teapot", it is transported into the "teacup".
> 
> **Explanation for Candidate Answers**:
> 
> - $E_A$: "Passengers" do not need to be transported into "taxi" after taking a "bus". "Taxi" and "bus" are different ways of transportation.
> 
> - $E_B$: The "bookshelf" is in the "reading room".
> 
> - $E_C$: Both "school" and "enterprise" are organizations. After "talents" are educated in "school", they are transported into "enterprise".
> 
> - $E_D$: After "textbooks" are printed in the "printing factory", they are sold in a "bookstore". But the terms order is inconsistent with the query.

### How to Load the Dataset?

```python3
import datasets   # ðŸ¤—
ekar_zh = datasets.load_dataset('Jiangjie/ekar_chinese')
ekar_en = datasets.load_dataset('Jiangjie/ekar_chinese')
```

## Supported Tasks in E-KAR and Task Modes

There are altogether `8` task settings: `2 shared tasks` * `2 task modes` * `2 languages`.

### E-KAR supports two shared tasks: 
- `analogical-qa`: The dataset can be used to train a model for analogical reasoning in the form of multiple-choice QA.
- `explanation-generation`: The dataset can be used to generate free-text explanations to rationalize analogical reasoning.

### E-KAR also supports two task modes: 
- `EASY mode`: where query explanation ($E_Q$) can be used as part of the input.
- `HARD mode`: no explanation is allowed as part of the input.

### E-KAR supports two languages:
- `Chinese version`: 1,655 problems and 8,275 sentences of explanations, sourced from Civil Service Exams of China with manually annotated explanations.
  - Train split: 1155
  - Validation split: 165
  - Blind test split: 335
- `English version`: 1,251 problems and 6,255 sentences of explanations, translated from Chinese version with culture-specific samples removed or rewritten.
  - Train split: 870
  - Validation split: 119
  - Blind test split: 262

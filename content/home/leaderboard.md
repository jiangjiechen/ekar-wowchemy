Please submit and evaluate your results on the test sets at the publicly available [E-KAR leaderboard](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1671/overview) hosted at EvalAI.

Note that the leaderboard only evaluates Analogical QA and Rationalized Analogical QA tasks, in order to avoid using unreliable automatic metrics for evaluating text generation (i.e., explanations).
See the [E-KAR leaderboard](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1671/overview) for participation details.
